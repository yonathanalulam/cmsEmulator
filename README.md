I built this Python app to visualize real high-energy physics collisions from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

Instead of just looking at numbers, this tool renders actual sensor data from the CMS experiment in 3D. It applies real physics math (the Lorentz Force) to show how subatomic particles move through magnetic fields.

What It Does
3D Replay: Visualizes verified collision events where muons were detected.

Physics Analysis: Automatically calculates the mass of the "invisible" parent particle (like the Z-Boson or J/Psi Meson).

Educational Context: Tells you exactly what you're looking at and why it matters scientifically.
